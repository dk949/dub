Locations of certain directories can be controlled with environment variables

System Settings, User Settings and Local Repository can be relocated by setting
`DUB_SYSTEM_SETTINGS_PATH`, `DUB_USER_SETTINGS_PATH` and
`DUB_LOCAL_REPOSITORY_PATH` respectively to the desired directory.

If these variables are not set, behaviour is unchanged.
